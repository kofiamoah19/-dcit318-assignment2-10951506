Overview
This assignment involves creating a C# console application to demonstrate various aspects of object-oriented programming, including inheritance, method overriding, abstract classes, and interfaces.

OBJECTIVES.
Inheritance and Method Overriding
Abstract Classes and Methods
Interfaces
TASKS:

1. INHERITANCE AND METHOD OVERRIDING.
Define a base class called Animal with a method MakeSound() that prints "Some generic sound".
Create a derived class Dog that overrides the MakeSound() method to print "Bark".
Create another derived class Cat that overrides the MakeSound() method to print "Meow".
In the Main method, create instances of Animal, Dog, and Cat, and call the MakeSound() method on each instance.

2. ABSTRACT CLASSES AND METHOD.
Define an abstract class called Shape with an abstract method GetArea().
Create a derived class Circle that implements GetArea() to calculate the area of a circle.
Create another derived class Rectangle that implements GetArea() to calculate the area of a rectangle.
In the Main method, create instances of Circle and Rectangle, and display their areas.

3. INTERFACES.
Define an interface called IMovable with a method Move().
Create a class Car that implements IMovable and prints "Car is moving" when Move() is called.
Create a class Bicycle that implements IMovable and prints "Bicycle is moving" when Move() is called.
In the Main method, create instances of Car and Bicycle, and call the Move() method on each instance.
